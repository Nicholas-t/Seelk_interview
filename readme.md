Objective 
1. Open a CSV file and perform some tasks on it.
2. Create a copy of the Dataset in a columnar format (You can choose between Parquet or ORC) and save it.
3. Open the columnar file from 2, and create a new "clean" dataset:
 Remove all the text columns and just leave the numeric ones (id, points, price).
Store the clean dataset in the same columnar format.
4. Using the columnar copy from 2, create an aggregation:
Aggregate the data by country, and calculate the average of points and the standard deviation.
Store the aggregation in the same columnar format.
