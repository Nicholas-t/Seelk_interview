11955,11955,Portugal,"A firm wine, based on dry tannins and some dense fruit. It has acidity, driven by black berry flavors. The core of the wine is dry, both from wood and acidity, and it will benefit from 2–3 years' aging.",Mural Reserva,91,10.0,Douro,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Quinta do Portal 2007 Mural Reserva Red (Douro),Portuguese Red,Quinta do Portal
26101,26101,US,"With full ripeness, density and concentration, this keeps its superb balance at just 10.8% alcohol and 5% residual sugar. The dynamic tension plays out beautifully, and doesn't veer into any sort of sugary slackness. This has the sort of weight and complexity you would expect in a $30 wine.",Winemaker's Select,91,8.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Snoqualmie 2006 Winemaker's Select Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),Riesling,Snoqualmie
10386,10386,US,"A marvelous effort in a difficult year, this textbook Washington Riesling is bursting with apricot and peach goodness.

120131,120131,Portugal,"This is a fine wine, with great structure and ripe fruit. Dark tannins, a tense mineral texture and blackberry tones are all there, giving a wine that's rich and full bodied.

40258,40258,US,"This contends for the best $10 Riesling in the country. It's off dry, with 30g/L of residual sugar, but not too sweet for some Asian noodle entrées. The mouthfeel is thick and borders on syrupy, with penetrating flavors of mango, papaya and peaches. It could also be served after dinner with fruit and soft cheeses.",,91,10.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Lujon 2015 Riesling (Willamette Valley),Riesling,Lujon
